# ✅ Conclusion

- The Naive Bayes model achieved high accuracy in classifying spam messages.
- Precision and recall are strong, making it a good baseline model.

### 🔁 Improvements You Can Try:
- Use TF-IDF vectorization instead of CountVectorizer.
- Try other algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, or Random Forest.
- Tune model using `GridSearchCV`.
