# ✉️ Spam Email Detection Using Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)

## 🎯 Objective:
Create a machine learning model using **scikit-learn** to classify messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**.

We will use the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset** and implement:
- Text preprocessing
- Vectorization (Bag-of-Words)
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall)
